# bwi_gridworld

## Instructions

For notational purposes we will use CSID to represent your UTCS ID.

Setting up is really easy, once you've cloned all you have to do is set the
remote location to your specified repo.  Once you push, your code will be
cloned on the server, subsequently compiled and the results will be given back
to you.


1. git clone CSID@inux.cs.utexas.edu:/u/matteo/class/bwi_gridworld.git
2. cd bwi_gridworld
3. git remote add submission_server CSID@104.236.234.64:/fri/CSID/agent.git
4. git push submission_server master

## Submitting

Your progress is tracked, there isn't a formal final submission. We will grade
the last submission you push before the deadline.
